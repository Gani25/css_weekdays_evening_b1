    <h1>Independence Day India</h1>
    <p>Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as a public holiday in India commemorating the nation's
        independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947. On this day the Indian Independence Act 1947 came into
        effect,
        transferring legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly. India attained independence following
        the
        independence movement noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil disobedience led by Indian National
        Congress
        under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.[1]

        Independence coincided with the partition of India,[2] in which British India was divided into the Dominions of
        India
        and Pakistan; the partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties. On 15 August 1947, the first
        Prime
        Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru raised the Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in
        Delhi. On
        each subsequent Independence Day, the incumbent Prime Minister customarily raises the flag and gives an address
        to the
        nation.[3] The entire event is broadcast by Doordarshan, India's national broadcaster, and usually begins with
        the
        shehnai music of Ustad Bismillah Khan. Independence Day is observed throughout India with flag-hoisting
        ceremonies,
        parades and cultural events. It is a national holiday in the country.[4][5][6]</p>
